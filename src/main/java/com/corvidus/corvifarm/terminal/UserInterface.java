 * Writing my own user interface here, as opposed to using the existing one.
 * This is not just a case of "Not Invented Here", but of having different needs:
 * - different aesthetics which look less like a traditional windows system
 * - focus management in a way that several widgets should either react in
 *   parallel to key presses (such as the character, inventory and room) or one
 *   or two widgets should get privileged access (for instance a store or
 *   inventory management)
