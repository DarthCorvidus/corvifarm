# Corvifarm

This project is to satisfy two personal requirements:

* I always wanted to do *some* sort of game, no matter how simple
* I want to brush up my Java 'skills' and have some sort of real Java project

The idea is to have a command line based farm game. The first milestone is to reach the central game loop (till, water, plant, wait, sell, buy seeds, till...). A meta gamer's dream, you're able to get rich without any distractions.
